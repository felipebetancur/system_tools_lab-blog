I specialize in **Embedded Systems** and in the integration of *hardware* and *firmware* to design innovative electronic prototypes.

My experience includes:

* **Characterization and optimization of systems using Linux:** Utilizing **perf** for workload characterization and exploring the potential of **eBPF** for next-generation performance and security analysis.
* **Firmware Design:** Low-level development with **FreeRTOS** and **C/C++**, to create educational electronic prototypes focused on audio and music applications.

### **Engineering, Innovation, and Intellectual Property** 🔬

I am co-founder and developer of **Druman**, a musical *wearable* based on **IoMusT** (Internet of Musical Things). This project, which combines technology, rhythm, and psychomotricity, has a **Utility Model Patent** 🏆 in Colombia.

### **My Musical Connection** 🎸

I'm an **Electric Bassist**, and music is a fundamental part of my life. This passion is not just a *hobby*; it guides my technical approach. I enjoy studying sound and audio, understanding **latency** not only as a *technical* problem but as a barrier that breaks the human experience.

### **About This Blog** 🚀

This space is a laboratory of exploration, driven by my participation in the **Hackathon eBPF Summit 2025**. Here I share resources, tutorials, and *open source* tools (such as **eBPF**, **perf**, **QEMU**, **KVM**, **KiCAD**) to advance modern engineering.
> **Connect with my main work!** This blog focuses on *open source* and the *kernel*, but if you are looking for my professional services in **IoMusT**, **low latency**, and **technical documentation in LaTeX**, I invite you to visit my main site: <a href="https://felipebetancur-blog.netlify.app/" target="_blank">felipebetancur-blog</a>.

Thank you for visiting my blog and for your interest in my work!
